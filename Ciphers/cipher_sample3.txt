TO C. IULIUS CAESAR IN GAUL, FROM ROME, FEBRUARY 54 BC

CICERO GREETS CAESAR, IMPERATOR. OBSERVE HOW FAR I HAVE CONVINCED MYSELF
THAT YOU ARE MY SECOND SELF, NOT ONLY IN MATTERS WHICH CONCERN ME PERSONALLY,
BUT EVEN IN THOSE WHICH CONCERN MY FRIENDS. IT HAD BEEN MY INTENTION TO TAKE
GAIUS TREBATIUS WITH ME FOR WHATEVER DESTINATION I SHOULD BE LEAVING TOWN,
IN ORDER TO BRING HIM HOME AGAIN HONOURED AS MUCH AS MY ZEAL AND FAVOUR COULD MAKE HIM.
BUT WHEN POMPEY REMAINED AT HOME LONGER THAN I EXPECTED, AND A CERTAIN HESITATION ON
MY PART (WITH WHICH YOU ARE NOT UNACQUAINTED) APPEARED TO HINDER, OR AT ANY RATE TO
RETARD, MY DEPARTURE,[1] I PRESUMED UPON WHAT I WILL NOW EXPLAIN TO YOU.
I BEGIN TO WISH THAT TREBATIUS SHOULD LOOK TO YOU FOR WHAT HE HAD HOPED FROM ME,
AND, IN FACT, I HAVE BEEN NO MORE SPARING OF MY PROMISES OF GOODWILL ON YOUR PART THAN
I HAD BEEN WONT TO BE OF MY OWN. MOREOVER, AN EXTRAORDINARY COINCIDENCE HAS OCCURRED
WHICH SEEMS TO SUPPORT MY OPINION AND TO GUARANTEE YOUR KINDNESS. FOR JUST AS I WAS
SPEAKING TO OUR FRIEND BALBUS[2] ABOUT THIS VERY TREBATIUS AT MY HOUSE, WITH MORE
THAN USUAL EARNESTNESS, A LETTER FROM YOU WAS HANDED TO ME, AT THE END OF WHICH YOU
SAY: "MISCINIUS RUFUS, WHOM YOU RECOMMEND TO ME, I WILL MAKE KING OF GAUL, OR, IF
YOU CHOOSE, PUT HIM UNDER THE CARE OF LEPTA. SEND ME SOME ONE ELSE TO PROMOTE."
I AND BALBUS BOTH LIFTED OUR HANDS IN SURPRISE: IT CAME SO EXACTLY IN THE NICK OF
TIME, THAT IT APPEARED TO BE LESS THE RESULT OF MERE CHANCE THAN SOMETHING PROVIDENTIAL.
I THEREFORE SEND YOU TREBATIUS, AND ON TWO GROUNDS, FIRST THAT IT WAS MY SPONTANEOUS
IDEA TO SEND HIM, AND SECONDLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE INVITED ME TO DO SO.
I WOULD BEG YOU, DEAR CAESAR, TO RECEIVE HIM WITH SUCH A DISPLAY OF KINDNESS AS TO
CONCENTRATE ON HIS SINGLE PERSON ALL THAT YOU CAN BE POSSIBLY INDUCED TO BESTOW FOR
MY SAKE UPON MY FRIENDS. AS FOR HIM I GUARANTEE?NOT IN THE SENSE OF THAT HACKNEYED
EXPRESSION OF MINE, AT WHICH, WHEN I USED IT IN WRITING TO YOU ABOUT MILO,
YOU VERY PROPERLY JESTED, BUT IN GOOD ROMAN LANGUAGE SUCH AS SOBER MEN USE?THAT NO
HONESTER, BETTER, OR MORE MODEST MAN EXISTS. ADDED TO THIS, HE IS AT THE TOP OF
HIS PROFESSION AS A JURISCONSULT, POSSESSES AN UNEQUALED MEMORY, AND THE MOST PROFOUND LEARNING.
FOR SUCH A MAN I ASK NEITHER A TRIBUNESHIP, PREFECTURE, NOR ANY DEFINITE OFFICE,
I ASK ONLY YOUR GOODWILL AND LIBERALITY: AND YET I DO NOT WISH TO PREVENT YOUR COMPLIMENTING HIM,
IF IT SO PLEASE YOU, WITH EVEN THESE MARKS OF DISTINCTION.
IN FACT, I TRANSFER HIM ENTIRELY FROM MY HAND, SO TO SPEAK, TO YOURS, WHICH IS AS
SURE A PLEDGE OF GOOD FAITH AS OF VICTORY. EXCUSE MY BEING SOMEWHAT IMPORTUNATE,
THOUGH WITH A MAN LIKE YOU THERE CAN HARDLY BE ANY PRETEXT FOR IT?HOWEVER,
I FEEL THAT IT WILL BE ALLOWED TO PASS.
BE CAREFUL OF YOUR HEALTH AND CONTINUE TO LOVE ME AS EVER.
